# Lemuras

Sometimes you cannot or don't want to use Pandas or similar advanced tool for data analysis, but still have a need to manipulate large tables. In such cases you can use **Lemuras** â€“ it is a *pure Python* library in a single file without dependencies. And if you have some experience of Pandas or SQL, then you can easily work with Lemuras.

Again, this library may be considered as a simplified analogue of Pandas, but not as a replacement. However, Lemuras is capable of processing an operation on a few tables with several thousands of rows in less than a second.

## Features

- Integration with *Jupyter IPython Notebook*: Lemuras objects are printed as nice tables.
- Most of the syntax is very similar to *Pandas*.
- Save / load **CSV files**.
- Cells accessing, columns renaming, rows sorting, functions/lambdas applying.
- Dealing with **columns**: you can take a table column, do math with the values, compare, check existing in other column or list, then filter a table by , etc.
- **Grouping by** *none*, *one*, or *multiple columns*, **aggregation** with *built-in* or *user-defined functions and lambdas*.
- **Merge** (**Join**): *inner / left / right / outer*.
- **Pivot tables** creation.

It was tasted on both Python **2.7.13** and Python **3.6.0**.


## Examples

All the features are described in notebook examples:

1. [Basic things](https://github.com/AivanF/Lemuras/blob/master/Example%201%20-%20Basic%20things.ipynb)
1. [Group by](https://github.com/AivanF/Lemuras/blob/master/Example%202%20-%20Group%20By.ipynb)
1. [Merge / Join](https://github.com/AivanF/Lemuras/blob/master/Example%203%20-%20Merge%20Join.ipynb)
1. [Pivot table](https://github.com/AivanF/Lemuras/blob/master/Example%204%20-%20Pivot%20table.ipynb)

In addition, there is one complex example of solving a real-life problem:

- [Retargeting results report](https://github.com/AivanF/Lemuras/blob/master/Complex%20Example%20-%20Retargeting%20results%20report.ipynb)

The code is well-commented, so, you can find useful information there. Contributions are welcome.


## TODOs

There are some things that are good to be implemented:

- **Tables concatenation**. Like `UNION` in *SQL* or `pd.concat` in *Pandas*.
- **Tables creation by columns**. For now there is no built-in way to add or delete columns, or create a new table with different columns.
